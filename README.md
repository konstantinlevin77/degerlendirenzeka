# DeÄŸerlendiren Zeka

## Overview 

ğŸ‡¹ğŸ‡· DeÄŸerlendiren Zeka, yinelenen sinir aÄŸlarÄ± Ã¼zerine kurulmuÅŸ, Ã¼zerinde eÄŸitilen sorularÄ±n cevaplarÄ±n doÄŸruluÄŸunu deÄŸerlendirebilen bir kontrol etme sistemidir. DeÄŸerlendiren Zeka'nÄ±n derin Ã¶ÄŸrenme tarafÄ±nda Tensorflow kÃ¼tÃ¼phanesi, API tarafÄ±nda ise micro framework Flask kullanÄ±lmÄ±ÅŸtÄ±r.

ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§ Evaluator Intelligence is a checking system based on recurrent neural networks which is able to evaluate the answers of the questions that's been used in training process. At the deep learning side of Evaluative Intelligence Tensorflow library, at the API side Flask were used.

## Technologies

### Deep Learning
* Gated Recurrent Units are used as recurrent neural networks.
* Word Vectors (with the embedding layers of Tensorflow)

### Backend
